# README

This work-in-progress app allows playgroups to keep game scores and playersâ€™ results over time, as well as track analytics of deck performance. It is mainly written as a personal project for myself, to simulate working within a BDD agile development team. As the project nears the MVP stage I will add more details here about how to run the project locally. The end goal is to deploy and host this on a dedicated website for public use.
